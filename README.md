## Process Description

### 1. Original Audio Extraction
The original audio was extracted to isolate and modify specific sound elements.

### 2. Creating a drug dealer atmosphere
#### Sound Effects:
- Added micro uzi, car crash, door knocking sounds, glass knocking, baseball bat sound and an audio from the Colombia tv series "Pablo Escobar el patrón del mal".

#### Music and Rythm adjustments:
Removed the original percussion as it disrupted the flow. Added a new track "Raton y Queso" from "El cartel de los Sapos" written by Alberto Ramon to fit the new Narco film genre.

### 3. Voces y Balance de Audio
- The voices were recorded by the authors and added two lines to represent the character Pablo Escobar from two tv shows: "Pablo Escobar el patrón del mal" and "Narcos". 

### 4. Merging Audio and Video
- Replace the video Audio, preserving the vanilla version of the trailer.

### 5. Final Export
- The edited trailer was exported, maintaining the original duration but with a completely transformed audio experience.
